In what direction?
Drop what?
There is no door there.
The door refuses to budge.
The door opens.
The door is already open.
The door closes.
The door is already closed.
You see no up stairs here.
You see no down stairs here.
There are no items here.
Your inventory is full.
Nevermind.
You stumble upon a hidden passage!
