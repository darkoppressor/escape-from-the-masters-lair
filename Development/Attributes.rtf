\par
Creatures have a vector of statuses. When they walk through water or otherwise have water on them, they become wet.\par
They dry out at some rate (perhaps each dungeon level should have a temperature that affects this?).\par
If a wet creature is hit with something cold enough, like a frost spell, that creature becomes frozen. Etc.\par
\par
There are no classes. You do get a class name, but it is determined by your attributes and skills, and is just descriptive.\par
Instead of choosing a class at the beginning of the game, you choose what skills to focus on.\par
All skills and attributes start at pretty low defaults, which are the same every game (so no point in start-scumming). When you choose your focus, your focused skills increase a bit.\par
Focused skills increase a little faster than regular ones.\par
\strike The player levels up in the classic way, by gaining enough experience points.\strike0\par
\strike Experience is gained through a variety of means, but the main one is obviously fighting monsters.\strike0\par
\par
Means of gaining experience:\par
\strike\tab Killing creatures.\strike0\par
\tab Raising skills (all or just focused?).\par
\tab Discovering a new dungeon level.\par
\par
Gender is selectable, but does not affect anything.\par
Race can be chosen, and increases some skills, attributes, and grants abilities and more.\par
All races in the game should be available to both the player and the monster generator.\par
When you level up, you can select between 1 and 3 attributes to increase. The 1-3 range is determined by some function of the level.\par
As a skill increases during a given level, it adds to a multiplier for the associated skill.\par
This multiplier increases the amount by which the attribute is increased if selected during level-up.\par
For example, a x2 multiplier is on strength. The player levels up, and chooses to increase strength. Instead of only gaining 1 point of strength, you gain 2.\par
\par
Attributes increase much more slowly than skills.\par
\par
\cf1\strike Attributes, skills, etc., should be doubles, and can increase by a decimal amount. UPDATE: I think I am changing them back to simple shorts.\cf0\strike0\par
\par
There should be some things that can give penalties to offensive and defensive actions, as well.\par
For offensive, wielding a weapon you shouldn't be gives a pretty big damage reduction.\par
If you wear armor you shouldn't wear, it will give a reduction to movement speed, chance to hit, chance to dodge, and chance to crit.\par
If you wear non-magic user armor, you will suffer a penalty to magic damage.\par
\par
\strike Each time you level up, you gain max health and max mana.\strike0\par
