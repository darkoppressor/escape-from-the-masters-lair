# escape-from-the-masters-lair
Escape from the Lair of Loathing with enough Runestones to stop an evil overlord in this Roguelike adventure

Escape began as a 7DRL for the 2011 contest. Unfortunately, it was a failure. It did not even have a name at the time of the contest’s end. However, I decided to continue developing it, as I had many fun ideas and I’ve always wanted to actually finish a Roguelike. Thus, Escape from the Master’s Lair was officially born… You are a monster living out your life within a dungeon deep underground. You live to serve the Master. However, the Master is becoming increasingly evil, and has begun to seek a forgotten and forbidden power. Fearing the results of this new thirst for power, you have taken it upon yourself to steal the Runestones, the source of your Master’s new power, and escape from the Lair of Loathing with them. Go forth, and achieve your destiny!
