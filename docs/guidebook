//===Escape from the Master's Lair - Guidebook===\\
//========A Primer on the Lair of Loathing=======\\

== Getting Started ==

	So, you've decided to play the game. Good for you! You have taken your first step into
	a larger world. Well, a relatively fun one, anyway. But I digress...
	
	When you run the game, you will find yourself on the name entry screen, also known as the
	"Who are you?" screen. When you type in your name, you are choosing the name for the character
	you will be controlling, and the name for any save file(s) associated with this particular
	playthrough, so choose a name you like. You wouldn't want to get a great score and have an
	ugly name up there on the highscores board now, would you?
	
	After entering your name, you will be asked to select a race. Races carry with them a variety of
	bonuses and penalties, and these are hinted at by the descriptions attached to each race.
	Simply type in the number of the race you wish you be, and a description will pop up
	at the bottom of the screen. When you are happy with your choice, press enter.
	
	It should be said that the escape key will go back to the previous screen while in any
	of these character creation screens. This is also a good time to mention the 
	"make my character for me" options that are available to you. At any time, you can press '=' to
	have the game create a decent character for you from scratch. Or, you can press '!' to have the
	game create a random character. If you don't want the game to create a complete character for you,
	you can use '-' to automatically make decent choices for you on the current screen only. Again,
	you can instead press '*' to have the game make random automatic choices on the current screen instead.
	The random automated choices are not recommended for beginners, children, small animals, or people
	who are easily frightened.
	
	After you have chosen a race, you will be asked to select exactly 3 skills to "focus" on.
	Your focused skills gain one level right when the game starts, and contribute more to your
	attribute multipliers each level (more on that later). Put simply, you want to choose the 3 skills
	that best represent the style of play you want to employ with this character. For example, say you
	chose a gnome as your race. Gnomes have a big bonus to their Stabbing Weapons skill, so you would
	probably want to select Stabbing Weapons as one of your focused skills.
	
	The final screen in character creation is the starting items screen. Here, you can select from
	a wide variety of items to start your character out with. Let's look to our gnome example from the
	previous paragraph. Our gnome has a bonus to the Stabbing Weapons skill, and has also focused in that
	same skill. So, shouldn't we start him off with a stabbing weapon of some kind? Indeed, we should.
	As it happens, there is exactly one such weapon on this starting items list. The spear. So, we
	select the spear. At the top of the screen, you can see your starting gold, which is a fancy name
	for "arbitrary points used to prevent you from starting with all the items." Using the remaining gold,
	you can buy some armor, and perhaps a bottle of water or something. It's all pretty useful stuff.
	
	So, we've finally finished creating our character, and we've progressed on to the story screen. Here,
	you are given a brief introduction to who you are, and why you are doing what you are doing.
	
	At last, we can actually begin playing the game! The following section gives an overview
	of the controls you will need to know to succeed in the Lair of Loathing. Go forth, and attain
	your destiny!
